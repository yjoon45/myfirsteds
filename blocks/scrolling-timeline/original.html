            <p>Busaburo Otsuka founded Otsuka in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, with an unconventional idea and the belief
                that anything is possible. Otsuka has been on a journey of creativity and innovation ever since.</p>

            <p>The first Otsuka US research and development base was established in Rockville, Maryland. Just a few
                years later, in 1989, Otsuka’s first US commercial organization was created, Otsuka America
                Pharmaceutical, Inc (OAPI).</p>

            <p>Otsuka’s second US location, in Princeton, New Jersey, was opened. We continued our evolution, and in
                2007 Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &amp; Commercialization, Inc (OPDC), was created to oversee all
                commercial pharmaceutical and medical device activities in the United States.</p>
